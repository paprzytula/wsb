### SQLITE issues after change from mysql
It was resolved by commenting DB_DATABASE=, thanks to an article: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43140711/database-database-database-sqlite-does-not-exist-database-works-from-artisan

remember to add **@csrf** just above submit button (server will generate token for your page)

### Order of commands in function is important

 `public function store()
    {
       $service = new \App\Service();
        $service->name = request('name');
        $service->save();
        return redirect()->back();
    }`
### htmltagwrap - vs code extension
Wraps your selection in HTML tags. Can wrap inline selections and selections that span multiple lines (works with both single selections and multiple selections at once).

To use, select one or many chunks of code and press "Alt + W" ("Option + W" for Mac).

### Form - old value, accepted by validation
 `<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="ImiÄ™" autocomplete="off" value="{{ old('name') }}">`
